# **One-Prompt Site Build Brief** (continued)

```
WHITE PAPER HUB (/safety-guides/): 10 pillar pages, each with 4 
supporting blog posts. Priority order: ADAS Calibration > OEM vs 
Aftermarket > Repair vs Replace > Choosing Installer > remaining 6.

LEAD GEN PAGE (/find-installers/): Multi-step form collecting ZIP, 
phone, email, vehicle details, service type, urgency. Pre-fill from 
quiz data. Emphasize "Vero Verified Network" trust signals.

RESOURCES: Glossary, FAQ, interactive 50-state insurance law table, 
ADAS vehicle database, certification directory.

CTA STRATEGY: 
- Homepage hero = Primary quiz
- Quiz results = Find Installers (pre-filled)
- White papers = Sidebar lead widget + relevant quiz
- All pages = Persistent "Find Installers" in header

CONVERSION FLOW: Quiz → Results → Find Installers → Thank You
SECONDARY FLOW: White Paper → Quiz → Find Installers
TERTIARY FLOW: Blog Post → White Paper → Quiz → Find Installers

TECHNICAL STACK:
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Quiz engine with conditional logic & scoring
- Form pre-population from quiz data
- Schema markup (Quiz, FAQPage, Article, LocalBusiness)
- Analytics tracking: quiz completion, form abandonment, CTA clicks
- Lead routing to Vero network based on ZIP

DESIGN PRIORITIES:
1. Trust signals everywhere (certifications, verified network badges)
2. Clean, professional, safety-focused aesthetic
3. Clear visual hierarchy (education → urgency → action)
4. Sticky header with "Find Installers" CTA
5. Exit-intent popups on high-value pages

CONTENT TONE: Authoritative but accessible. Research-backed. 
Safety-focused without being alarmist. Technical depth that builds 
trust. Clear CTAs without being pushy.

OPTIMIZATION: Fast load times, core web vitals, structured data, 
semantic HTML, AI-friendly formatting (clear H2 questions, tables, 
lists, citations).
