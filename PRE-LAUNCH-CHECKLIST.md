## üîß TO DO: Critical Path (Must complete before launch)

### 1. Supabase Database Setup ‚è±Ô∏è 25 minutes

**File**: SUPABASE-QUICK-SETUP.md

**Steps**:
1. [ ] Get Supabase credentials from dashboard
   - Project URL (already have: https://exzeayeoosiabwhgyquq.supabase.co)
   - Anon key
   - Service role key
   - DATABASE_URL
   - DIRECT_URL

2. [ ] Update `.env.local` with real credentials

3. [ ] Run database migration:
   ```bash
   cd /home/sam/Documents/github-repos/windshieldadvisor/windshieldadvisor
   npm run db:generate
   npm run db:push
   ```

4. [ ] Verify 5 tables created in Supabase dashboard:
   - QuizSession
   - PhoneClick
   - EmailCapture
   - LeadTrackingEvent
   - AnalyticsSummary

5. [ ] (Optional) Enable Row Level Security policies

**Why Critical**: Without database, quizzes can't track conversions.

---

### 2. Email Sequence Implementation ‚è±Ô∏è 3-4 hours

**File**: EMAIL-SEQUENCES.md

**Priority Order**:

**Phase 1: Quiz Results Email (HIGHEST PRIORITY)** ‚è±Ô∏è 2 hours
- [ ] Create React Email template for quiz results
- [ ] Implement `/api/email/quiz-results.ts` endpoint
- [ ] Test with dummy quiz completion
- [ ] Verify email sends via Resend
- [ ] Check tracking in EmailCapture table

**Phase 2: Abandoned Quiz Recovery** ‚è±Ô∏è 1 hour
- [ ] Create abandoned quiz detection logic
- [ ] Implement 1-hour reminder email
- [ ] Test triggering

**Phase 3: Content Subscriber Welcome** ‚è±Ô∏è 1 hour
- [ ] Create welcome email template
- [ ] Implement newsletter signup endpoint
- [ ] Test flow

**Phase 4: Weekly Newsletter** (Can launch without this)
- [ ] Set up weekly cron job
- [ ] Create newsletter template
- [ ] Schedule first edition

**Why Critical**: Email converts 3-5x better than cold traffic. Quiz results email is primary conversion driver.

---

### 3. Content Publishing (Week 1 Only) ‚è±Ô∏è 2 hours

**You don't need to publish all 45 pieces before launch!**

Just publish **Week 1 content** (5 pieces):

**Monday, Nov 4**:
- [ ] Publish ADAS Calibration white paper
- [ ] Publish "Why Uncalibrated ADAS Systems Are a Hidden Danger" blog

**Wednesday, Nov 6**:
- [ ] Publish "7 Dangerous Myths About ADAS Calibration" blog

**Friday, Nov 8**:
- [ ] Publish "How to Ensure Your ADAS Systems Work" blog
- [ ] Publish "Choosing the Right ADAS Calibration Service" blog

**How**: In Sanity Studio, set published status or update publishedAt date

**Why**: Start with highest-urgency content (ADAS = most critical safety topic)

---

### 4. Website Integration ‚è±Ô∏è 3-4 hours

**Current Status**: Sanity client configured, needs page updates

**Tasks**:
1. [ ] Create white paper detail page (`/white-papers/[slug].tsx`)
   - Fetch from Sanity
   - Display sections, FAQs, references
   - Add quiz CTA
   - Add Vero phone number CTA

2. [ ] Create blog post detail page (`/blog/[slug].tsx`)

   - Link to quizzes
   - Add email signup

4. [ ] Create white papers index (`/white-papers/index.tsx`)
   - List all published white papers
   - Filter by category

5. [ ] Create blog index (`/blog/index.tsx`)
   - List all published posts
   - Filter by category/tag

**Why Critical**: Content must be accessible on website!

---

### 5. SEO Basics ‚è±Ô∏è 1 hour

**Quick wins before launch**:

1. [ ] Update sitemap.xml
   ```bash
   # In Next.js, create app/sitemap.ts
   # Include all white papers and blog posts
   ```

2. [ ] Create robots.txt
   ```
   User-agent: *
   Allow: /
   Sitemap: https://windshieldadvisor.info/sitemap.xml
   ```

3. [ ] Add schema.org markup
   - Article schema for blog posts
   - FAQ schema for white papers
   - Organization schema for homepage

4. [ ] Submit to Google Search Console
   - Verify domain
   - Submit sitemap
   - Request indexing for Week 1 content

**Why Critical**: Google needs to know your content exists!

---

### 6. Analytics Setup ‚è±Ô∏è 30 minutes

**Plausible Analytics** (already in layout.tsx):

1. [ ] Verify script loading: `<script defer data-domain="windshieldadvisor.info" src="https://plausible.io/js/script.js"></script>`

2. [ ] Create goals in Plausible dashboard:
   - `Quiz Started`
   - `Quiz Completed`
   - `Phone Click`
   - `Email Captured`

3. [ ] Test event tracking:
   ```javascript
   plausible('Phone Click', {props: {location: 'quiz-results'}})
   ```

**Why Critical**: Can't optimize what you don't measure!

---

## üéØ OPTIONAL (Nice to Have, Not Required for Launch)

### LinkedIn Setup ‚è±Ô∏è 1 hour
- [ ] Create company page (or use personal profile)
- [ ] Write Week 1 post (Monday ADAS announcement)
- [ ] Schedule Week 2 post

**Skip if**: You don't want to do social media (perfectly fine!)

### Google Business Profile ‚è±Ô∏è 30 minutes
- [ ] Add Vero's Google Business listing
- [ ] Add link to Windshieldadvisor.info
- [ ] Post Week 1 white paper to GMB

**Value**: Local SEO boost

### Blog Post Field Completion ‚è±Ô∏è 3-4 hours
- [ ] Add missing excerpts to 26 blog posts
- [ ] Add keyTakeaways to all blogs

## ‚ö†Ô∏è COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID

**Instead**: Follow 12-week schedule religiously

### 2. Obsessing over social media
**Instead**: Focus on search and email (10x better ROI)

### 3. Waiting for perfection
**Instead**: Launch with Week 1 content, iterate based on data

### 4. Ignoring email sequences
**Instead**: Implement quiz results email FIRST (highest conversion)

### 5. Not tracking conversions
**Instead**: Set up Plausible goals and Supabase tracking before launch

---

## üÜò IF SOMETHING BREAKS

### Sanity Content Not Showing
**Check**:
1. Is content published in Sanity Studio?
2. Is NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID correct in .env.local?
3. Did you redeploy after changes?

### Database Connection Error
**Check**:
1. Is DATABASE_URL in .env.local?
2. Did you run `npm run db:push`?
3. Is Supabase project active?

### Email Not Sending
**Check**:
1. Is RESEND_API_KEY in .env.local?
2. Is FROM_EMAIL verified in Resend dashboard?
3. Check Resend logs for errors

**Fix**: Test with Resend dashboard first

### Plausible Not Tracking

1. Is script tag in layout.tsx?
2. Is data-domain correct?
3. Check browser console for errors

**Fix**: Verify script loading in browser DevTools
