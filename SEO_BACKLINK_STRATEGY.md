# SEO & Backlink Strategy for Quiz Widgets

## Does Embedding Create Backlinks?

### Standard Widget (quiz-embed.js) - **Limited SEO Value**

❌ **No meaningful backlink value** because:
- Content is in an iframe (separate domain)
- Links inside iframes may not pass PageRank
- Quiz content isn't indexed as part of host page
- Search engines see iframe as external content

The "Powered by" link exists but provides minimal SEO benefit.

---

### SEO-Enhanced Widget (quiz-embed-seo.js) - **Real SEO Value** ✅

The enhanced version provides **genuine backlink and citation value**:

## What Creates Real SEO Value

### 1. **Visible HTML Links on Host Page**

```html
<!-- These links are ON the partner's page, not in iframe -->
<a href="https://windshieldadvisor.info" rel="noopener">
  Windshield Advisor
</a>

<a href="https://windshieldadvisor.info/white-papers">
  View our research
</a>

<a href="https://windshieldadvisor.info/quizzes/adas-calibration">
  View Source
</a>
```

**Why this works:**
- Links are in partner's HTML (not iframe)
- Search engines crawl and index these links
- Passes PageRank/authority signals
- Creates topical relevance connection

### 2. **Schema.org Structured Data**

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Quiz",
  "name": "ADAS Calibration Assessment Quiz",
  "provider": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "Windshield Advisor",
    "url": "https://windshieldadvisor.info"
  },
  "citation": "https://windshieldadvisor.info/white-papers"
}
```

**Why this works:**
- Structured data tells search engines about the relationship
- Creates a formal citation/attribution
- Improves E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trust)
- May show in rich results

### 3. **Contextual Attribution**

The visible header and footer provide:
- **Brand mention** - "Windshield Advisor" appears on host page
- **Topic association** - Links windshield safety topics together
- **Co-citation signals** - Search engines see the relationship

<!-- Default: Follow (passes PageRank) -->
<a href="https://windshieldadvisor.info">
  Windshield Advisor
</a>

<!-- NoFollow (for paid/sponsored) -->
<a href="https://windshieldadvisor.info" rel="nofollow">
  Windshield Advisor
</a>
```

**Recommendation:**
- Use **regular follow links** (no rel attribute)
- This is editorial attribution, not paid/sponsored
- Genuine content relationship
- Search engines expect citations to be follow links

### When to Use NoFollow

Only if:
- Partnership is primarily commercial
- Money is exchanged for the widget placement
- Required by Google's paid link guidelines

If the widget provides genuine value and educational content, regular follow links are appropriate.

## Best Practices for Maximum SEO Value

### 1. Contextual Content Around Widget

```html
<h2>Check Your ADAS Calibration Status</h2>
<p>
  Modern vehicles rely on Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)
  for critical safety features. After windshield replacement, these
  systems often require recalibration. Use this assessment tool from
  <a href="https://windshieldadvisor.info">Windshield Advisor</a>,
  a trusted resource for windshield safety research.
</p>

<!-- Quiz widget here -->
<div class="windshield-advisor-quiz"
     data-quiz="adas-calibration"
     data-seo-mode="true"></div>
<script src="https://windshieldadvisor.info/quiz-embed-seo.js"></script>

<p>
  Learn more about ADAS calibration requirements in the comprehensive
  <a href="https://windshieldadvisor.info/white-papers/mandatory-adas-calibration-windshield-replacement">
    white paper on ADAS calibration
  </a>.
</p>
```

**Why this works:**
- Natural language context
- Multiple citation opportunities
- Topical relevance strengthened
- Better user experience

### 2. Place on Relevant Pages

**Good placement:**
- `/services/windshield-replacement` → ADAS calibration quiz
- `/insurance-claims` → Insurance coverage quiz

**Avoid:**
- Irrelevant pages (confuses search engines)

### 3. Use Multiple Quizzes Strategically

```html
<!-- On ADAS service page -->
<div class="windshield-advisor-quiz"
     data-quiz="adas-calibration"
     data-seo-mode="true"></div>

<!-- On insurance page -->
<div class="windshield-advisor-quiz"
     data-quiz="insurance-coverage"
     data-seo-mode="true"></div>

<!-- On damage assessment page -->
<div class="windshield-advisor-quiz"
     data-quiz="repair-replace"
     data-seo-mode="true"></div>
```

**Result:**
- 3 pages × 3 links each = 9 backlinks
