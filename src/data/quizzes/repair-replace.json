This is your most cost-effective choice.\n\n<strong>Why Repair?</strong> It's faster, significantly cheaper (often fully covered by insurance with no deductible), and better for the environment. Most importantly, it preserves the critical factory seal of your original windshield, which is vital for your car's structural integrity and ADAS system performance.\n\n<strong>Act quickly!</strong> Temperature changes and road vibrations can cause small chips to crack out, making a replacement necessary.",

Your windshield's structural integrity is compromised, and a full replacement is necessary to ensure your safety.\n\n<strong>Key Considerations for Replacement:</strong>\n\n• <strong>Glass Quality:</strong> Discuss OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) vs. Aftermarket glass with your technician. OEM is guaranteed to match your car's specifications.\n\n• <strong>Adhesives:</strong> Ensure the shop uses OEM-approved urethane and respects the safe drive-away time.\n\n• <strong>ADAS Calibration:</strong> If your car has safety features like lane-keep assist, a post-replacement ADAS camera calibration is <strong>mandatory</strong> for them to function correctly.",
