        "summary": "Nearly all automakers mandate ADAS calibration after every windshield replacement.",
        "explanation": "The windshield is a critical part of the camera's optical system. Even a microscopic change in its position or angle after replacement can cause a safety system to fail.\n\nA misaligned camera will not trigger a warning light, creating a \"silent failure.\" The system may not work in a crash, or could even cause one by braking or steering incorrectly. Do not drive the vehicle until a proper static and/or dynamic calibration is performed by a qualified technician.",

        "explanation": "Any event that can alter the geometry of the vehicle—like a collision, hitting a large pothole, suspension work, or a wheel alignment—can throw off the ADAS camera's precise alignment.\n\nThis is known as a \"recalibration event.\" To ensure your safety systems are aimed correctly and will function as designed, a professional calibration check is strongly recommended by vehicle manufacturers.",

        "explanation": "If you are noticing unusual behavior from your safety systems, this is a clear sign that a sensor, likely the forward-facing camera, is misaligned. This is a significant safety risk and should be addressed immediately.\n\nThis condition is dangerous because the system may make incorrect decisions, such as applying the brakes for no reason (\"phantom braking\") or steering the car out of its lane. A full diagnostic scan and recalibration are necessary.",

The systems should be functioning as intended.\n\nRemember to have the system recalibrated immediately if you have your windshield replaced or are involved in a collision in the future.",
