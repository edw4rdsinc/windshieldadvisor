The windshield won't have proper structural bond and could fail in a crash.\n\n<strong>The Danger:</strong>\n\nUsing this installer puts you at serious risk:\n\n• Safety systems may not function in a crash\n• Windshield may not provide proper roof support in rollover\n• Airbags may deploy incorrectly\n• You may unknowingly be part of insurance fraud\n• Substandard work could fail catastrophically\n\n<strong>What You Should Do:</strong>\n\nFind a different installer immediately.
