  "abstract": "This paper establishes that the calibration of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) is a non-negotiable, mandatory procedure following any windshield replacement. It details how ADAS cameras rely on the windshield as a critical optical component and explains why a replacement invariably alters the camera's precise alignment. Drawing on OEM mandates, federal agency guidance, and technical research, this analysis refutes common myths and highlights the severe safety consequences of skipping calibration, which can lead to a \"silent failure\" of life-saving systems like Automatic Emergency Braking and Lane Keeping Assist.",

Key features include:\n\n**Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB):** Automatically applies brakes to prevent or mitigate a collision.\n\n**Lane Departure Warning (LDW) / Lane Keeping Assist (LKA):** Monitors lane position and provides alerts or steering input.\n\n**Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC):** Maintains a set following distance from the vehicle ahead.\n\nThe \"eyes\" for many of these systems are a digital camera mounted to the interior of the windshield. This camera's data is processed to identify lane lines, vehicles, and other hazards.

The integrity of these life-saving systems is critically dependent on the precise alignment of their sensors, an alignment that is invariably compromised during a windshield replacement. For the safety of vehicle occupants and the public, calibration must be considered an integral and non-negotiable part of the service.",

    {
      "question": "Does my car need ADAS calibration after windshield replacement?",
      "answer": "If your vehicle has any advanced safety features like Automatic Emergency Braking, Lane Keeping Assist, or Adaptive Cruise Control, the answer is almost certainly yes. Nearly 90% of 2023 model year vehicles require calibration after windshield replacement."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will a warning light appear if my ADAS isn't calibrated?",
      "answer": "No. This is the most dangerous misconception. A misaligned camera will not typically trigger a warning light, creating a \"silent failure\" where your safety systems are compromised without your knowledge."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does ADAS calibration cost?",
      "answer": "Professional ADAS calibration typically costs between $150-$400, depending on the vehicle and calibration method required. This is a small price compared to the million-dollar liability risk of skipping it."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between static and dynamic calibration?",
      "answer": "Static calibration is performed in a shop with the vehicle stationary, using precise targets and a level floor. Dynamic calibration requires driving the vehicle on marked roads. Many vehicles require both methods for complete calibration."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can the ADAS system calibrate itself over time?",
      "answer": "No. No current ADAS system is capable of self-correcting its physical alignment after a windshield replacement. Professional calibration with specialized equipment is always required."
