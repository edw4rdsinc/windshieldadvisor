## Analytics Queries

### Most Valuable Quizzes (Drive Most Calls)

SELECT
  quiz_slug,
  COUNT(*) as total_clicks,
  COUNT(DISTINCT session_id) as unique_sessions
FROM phone_clicks
WHERE location = 'quiz-results'
GROUP BY quiz_slug
ORDER BY total_clicks DESC;
```

**Expected Leaders**:

### Conversion Rate by Quiz

```sql
SELECT
  quiz_completions.quiz_slug,
  COUNT(DISTINCT quiz_completions.session_id) as completions,
  COUNT(DISTINCT phone_clicks.session_id) as calls,
  ROUND(
    COUNT(DISTINCT phone_clicks.session_id)::FLOAT /
    COUNT(DISTINCT quiz_completions.session_id) * 100,
    2
  ) as conversion_rate
FROM quiz_completions
LEFT JOIN phone_clicks ON quiz_completions.session_id = phone_clicks.session_id
GROUP BY quiz_completions.quiz_slug
ORDER BY conversion_rate DESC;
```

**Target**: 10-15% quiz-to-call conversion rate

### Conversion by Result Severity

```sql
SELECT
  severity,
  COUNT(*) as phone_clicks
FROM phone_clicks
WHERE location = 'quiz-results'
GROUP BY severity
ORDER BY phone_clicks DESC;
```

**Hypothesis**: "critical" results â†’ highest call rate

## Key Metrics to Monitor

### Primary KPIs

1. **Quiz Completion Rate**
   - Target: 60%+ (people who start â†’ finish)

2. **Quiz-to-Call Conversion**
   - Target: 10-15% (quiz completions â†’ phone clicks)

3. **Overall Visitor-to-Call**
   - Target: 5-8% (site visitors â†’ phone clicks)

### Secondary Metrics

4. **Best Performing Quiz**
   - Which quiz drives most calls?

5. **Severity Impact**
   - Do "critical" results call more than "caution"?

6. **Time to Call**
   - How long between quiz completion and call?

## Plausible Dashboard Setup

**Domain**: windshieldadvisor.info

**Goals to Create**:
1. `Phone Click` - Custom event (already tracking)
2. `Quiz Started` - Track quiz engagement
3. `Quiz Completed` - Track completion rate
4. `Email Captured` - Secondary lead capture

**Funnel**:
```
Visit Homepage
  â†“
Start Quiz (60% target)
  â†“
Complete Quiz (90% target)
  â†“
Click Phone Number (15% target)
  â†“
CALL VERO
```

## Call Attribution

**Question**: How do we know if someone actually called after clicking?

**Answer**: We can't know for certain without call tracking software, but we can measure:

1. **Click Intent**: Phone clicks = strong intent to call
2. **Industry Benchmarks**: 60-80% of mobile phone clicks = actual calls
3. **Correlation**: Track if call volume at Vero increases after quiz campaigns

**Recommendation**: If you want definitive call attribution:
- Use CallRail or similar call tracking
- Get unique phone number for Windshield Advisor traffic
- Track which calls came from quiz clicks

## Integration with Vero Analytics

**Vero's Daily Email Reports** (from plausible-monitor):
- Currently tracks veroautoglass.com phone clicks
- Shows breakdown by button location

**Windshield Advisor Tracking**:
- Separate Plausible property
