3. **Abandoned Quiz Recovery** (2 emails)
4. **Weekly Newsletter** (ongoing)

### 4. Social Media ✅

**Answer**: **No, you don't need it.**

**Analysis**: `SOCIAL-MEDIA-ALTERNATIVES.md`

**Key Points**:
- Search will give you 10-15x better ROI than social
- Your content is built for search, not social discovery
- If you want to do it: LinkedIn 1x/week, auto-post to Facebook
- Better alternatives: Reddit, Google Business, PR, partnerships

**My Recommendation**: Skip social entirely until Month 4. Focus on search and email.

**Bottom Line**: You have permission to ignore social media. Your model doesn't need it.

3. Do I want to do social media? (If no → perfectly fine, skip it)
4. Is Vero ready for increased calls? (Make sure they know traffic is coming)

### After Launch:
1. What's my quiz completion rate? (Target: 60%)
2. What's my email open rate? (Target: 60% for quiz results)
3. What's my quiz-to-call rate? (Target: 10-15%)
4. Which content drives most conversions? (Double down on winners)

## Red Flags to Watch For

### Week 1-2:
- ⚠️ Zero quiz completions → Check quiz flow, simplify questions
- ⚠️ High bounce rate (>70%) → Check page load speed, mobile UX
- ⚠️ No email opens → Check spam folder, verify FROM_EMAIL

### Week 3-4:
- ⚠️ Traffic but no rankings → Check Google Search Console for indexing issues
- ⚠️ Quiz completions but no calls → Review quiz result CTAs, make phone number more prominent
- ⚠️ Emails bouncing → Verify email addresses, check Resend deliverability

### Month 2-3:
- ⚠️ Traffic plateau → Accelerate content release schedule
- ⚠️ Low conversion despite traffic → A/B test quiz CTAs, simplify conversion path
- ⚠️ Vero not converting calls → Review call quality, ensure they mention Windshield Advisor
